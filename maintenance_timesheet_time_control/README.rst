Installation
============

This module is auto-installed when ``maintenance_timesheet`` and
``project_timesheet_time_control`` are installed.

This module depends on modules found in these repositories:

-  `OCA/timesheet <https://github.com/OCA/timesheet>`__
-  `OCA/web <https://github.com/OCA/web>`__
-  `OCA/project <https://github.com/OCA/project>`__

Configuration
=============

Maintenance request must have a project defined for seeing the
start/stop buttons.

Usage
=====

In general the usage instructions from
``project_timesheet_time_control`` apply with the following additions.

Via maintenance requests:

1. Go to *Maintenance > Maintenance > Maintenance Requests*.
2. If a request has a running timesheet line, it will display a *Stop*
   button.
3. Other requests that have enabled timesheets will display a *Start*
   button that will open the same wizard as the timesheet lines,
   duplicating task's last timesheet line.
4. You can see the same in list view.
5. Click on any existing request or create a new one.
6. You can see the same feature in the action buttons box.

Note: All the *Start/Resume/Stop* features are disabled if you don't
belong to the *Timesheets/User* group or if you are viewing a timesheet
that belongs to another user.

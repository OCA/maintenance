Usage
=====

Once installed, first you should enable consumptions for a certain equipment
and filling a default warehouse for the picking operations:

Then, for every mainteance request of this equipment, *Picking List* button
allows us to make consumptions, that will be picking documents with their own 
sequence:

By default, the origin location for this operations will be the stock location
for the default warehouse, and destination a new *Consumptions* location, that
will not compute for stock inventory, like e.g. partner locations:

From both request and equipment forms these stock operations and *Product Moves*
are available.

Return operations are also enabled, and will be linked to the request and 
equipment as well:

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Product standard list. Enable defining product standard lists (at least, 
  product and quantity per line), and link them with equipments. Then, every 
  maintenance request could select one of them and automatically fill the 
  product and quantity list.
